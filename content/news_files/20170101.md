# First realfast FRB

On 23 August 2016 (and several times thereafter), the prototype realfast system detected FRB 121102. Details in [Chatterjee et al (2017)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature20797), "The direct localization of a fast radio burst and its host". VLA data of the bursts can be downloaded from [dataverse](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TLDKXG) and the VLA data analysis can be found on [github](https://github.com/caseyjlaw/FRB121102).
