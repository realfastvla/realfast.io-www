# Candidate Search Portal

The prototype *realfast* [candidate search interface](http://search.realfast.io) is up. For now, this database is filled with candidate visualizations of the nine published detections of FRB 121102. Expect new FRBs to show up once *realfast* begins to search commensally in mid-2018.
