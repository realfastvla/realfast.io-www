*realfast* has been supported via NSF awards NSF awards 2022546 (ATI, PI: Law) and 1714897 (AAG, PI: Burke-Spolaor). Early development supported by the [University of California Lab Fees Research Program](https://www.ucop.edu/research-initiatives/programs/lab-fees/index.html).

Technical development:
1. [Law et al. (2015)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2015ApJ...807...16L) describes a prototype *realfast* system that searched 200 hours and 200 TB of data for FRBs.
1. [Law et al. (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJS..236....8L/abstract) is the realfast project paper.
2. [Pokorny et al. (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018JAI.....750005P/abstract) describes the high-speed data distribution protocol.

Science using *realfast*:
1. [Chatterjee et al. (2017)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature20797) describes how a *realfast* prototype made the first interferometric localization and host identification of an FRB (see image below).
1. [Law et al. (2017)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...850...76L/abstract) present a detailed analysis of radio bursts from FRB 121102.
1. [Law et al. (2019)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...886...24L/abstract) presents a simultaneous fast/slow transient survey targeting SLSN.
1. [Marcote et al. (2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020Natur.577..190M/abstract) describes the localization of an FRB by the EVN and includes a deep image from commensal VLA/realfast observations.
