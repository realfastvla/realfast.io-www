*realfast* publications:

1. [Law et al. (2015)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2015ApJ...807...16L) describes a prototype *realfast* system that searched 200 hours and 200 TB of data for FRBs.
2. [Chatterjee et al. (2017)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature20797) describes how a *realfast* prototype made the first interferometric localization and host identification of an FRB (see image below).
3. [Law et al. (2017)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...850...76L/abstract) present a detailed analysis of radio bursts from FRB 121102.
